# coding-questions
This repo would have common coding questions asked in interviews, along with their probable approach to solutions.

Although, there are very good websites available now days having list of coding questions and answer (e.g geeksforgeeks),
But, they generally don't have solution in C language. 
This is one of the reason for this repo, but is not limited to it.

Feel free to raise a PR for questions which you feel are most commonly asked in interviews.
